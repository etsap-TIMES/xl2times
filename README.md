# xl2times

**Note: this tool is a work in progress and not yet in a useful state**

`xl2times` is an open source tool to convert TIMES model Excel input files to DD format ready for processing by [GAMS](https://www.gams.com/).  The intention is to make it easier for people to reproduce research results on TIMES models.

[TIMES](https://iea-etsap.org/index.php/etsap-tools/model-generators/times) is an energy systems model generator from the International Energy Agency that is used around the world to inform energy policy.
It is fully explained in the [TIMES Model Documentation](https://iea-etsap.org/index.php/documentation).

The Excel input format accepted by this tool is documented in the [TIMES Model Documentation PART IV](https://iea-etsap.org/docs/Documentation_for_the_TIMES_Model-Part-IV.pdf).  Additional table types are documented in the [VEDA support forum](https://forum.kanors-emr.org/printthread.php?tid=140).  Example inputs are available at https://github.com/kanors-emr/Model_Demo_Adv_Veda

## Installation and Basic Usage

You can install the latest published version of the tool from PyPI using pip (preferably in a virtual environment):
```bash
pip install xl2times
```

You can also install the latest development version by cloning this repository and running the following command in the root directory:
```bash
pip install .
```

After installation, run the following command to see the basic usage and available options:
```bash
xl2times --help
```

## Documentation

The tool's documentation is at http://xl2times.readthedocs.io/ and the source is in the [`docs/`](docs/) directory.

The documentation is generated by Sphinx and hosted on ReadTheDocs. We use the following extensions:
- `myst-parser`: to be able to write documentation in markdown
- `sphinx-book-theme`: the theme
- `sphinx-copybutton`: to add copy buttons to code blocks
- `sphinxcontrib-apidoc`: to automatically generate API documentation from the Python package

## Development

### Setup

We recommend installing the tool in editable mode (`-e`) in a Python virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -U pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .[dev]
```

We use the [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) code formatter. The `pip` command above will install it along with other requirements.

We also use the [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/) type checker -- our GitHub Actions check will fail if pyright detects any type errors in your code. You can install pyright in your virtual environment and check your code by running these commands in the root of the repository:
```bash
pip install pyright==1.1.304
pyright
```
Additionally, you can install a git pre-commit that will ensure that your changes are formatted and pyright detects no issues before creating new commits:
```bash
pre-commit install
```
If you want to skip these pre-commit steps for a particular commit, if for instance pyright has issues but you still want to commit your changes to your branch, you can run:
```bash
git commit --no-verify
```

### Running Benchmarks

See our GitHub Actions CI `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and the utility script `utils/run_benchmarks.py` to see how to run the tool on the DemoS models.

### Debugging Regressions

If your change is causing regressions on one of the benchmarks, a useful way to debug and find the difference is to run the tool in verbose mode and compare the intermediate tables. For example, if your branch has regressions on Demo 1:
```bash
# First, on the `main` branch:
xl2times benchmarks/xlsx/DemoS_001 --output_dir benchmarks/out/DemoS_001-all --ground_truth_dir benchmarks/csv/DemoS_001-all --verbose > before 2>&1
# Then, on your branch:
git checkout my-branch-name
xl2times benchmarks/xlsx/DemoS_001 --output_dir benchmarks/out/DemoS_001-all --ground_truth_dir benchmarks/csv/DemoS_001-all --verbose > after 2>&1
# And then compare the files `before` and `after`
code -d before after
```
VS Code will highlight the changes in the two files, which should correspond to any differences in the intermediate tables.

### Publishing the Tool

To publish a new version of the tool on PyPI, update the version number in `pyproject.toml`, and then run:
```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade build
python -m pip install --upgrade twine
rm -rf dist
python -m build
python -m twine upload dist/*
```
